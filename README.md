# Applied Mathematics in Mechanics
These are lecture notes and other items from my Applied Mathematics in Mechanics course. Note that this is an ongoing course. The goal is to have notes & study guides added weekly. ***I've fallen a little behind on getting all notes and notebooks on the repo but hope to get back to this after the midterm***

**Topics Include:**
- Dimensional Analysis & Scaling
  - [Dimensional Analysis](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mathematics-Mechanics/raw/master/Dimensional%20Analysis.pdf)
  - [Nondimensionalization](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mathematics-Mechanics/raw/master/Nondimensionalization.pdf)
- Perturbation Methods
  - [Perturbation Methods](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mathematics-Mechanics/raw/master/Perturbation%20Methods.pdf)
  - [Regular Perturbation Methods (IVP)](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mathematics-Mechanics/raw/master/Regular%20Perturbation%20IVP.pdf)
  - [Singular Perturbation](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mathematics-Mechanics/raw/master/Singular%20Perturbation.pdf)
  - [Multiple Boundary Layers Problem](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mathematics-Mechanics/raw/master/Multiple%20Boundary%20Layers%20Problem.pdf)
  - [Multiple Scales: Two-Timing](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mathematics-Mechanics/raw/master/Multiple%20Scales%20Two%20Timing.pdf)
- Variational Calculus
  - [Calculus of Variations]()
  - [First Variations & Geodesics]()
  - [Variational Calculus (Elastica)]()
  - [Lagrange Multipliers]()
- Dynamical Systems
  - [Stability & Linearity]()
  - [Stability & Bifurcation]()
- Differential Geometry

**Mathematica Notebooks:**
- [Introduction & Basics](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mathematics-Mechanics/blob/master/MMA1_mathematicaBasics.nb) - note that I did not create this notebook, Professor Holmes at BU did
- [Perturbation Example](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mathematics-Mechanics/blob/master/MMA2_regPert_Intro.nb) - note that I did not create this notebook, Professor Holmes at BU did

**Literature Reviews:**
- [Bubble Collapse & Wrinkling](https://github.com/leahgaeta/Mathematics-Mechanics/raw/master/Bubble_Collapse%26Wrinkling_Q%26A.pdf)
